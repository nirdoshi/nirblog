	<p class="intro_content"><b>Language:</b> While some people may speak English or other European languages, French is by far the most spoken language in the city.
		<br><br>
<b>Currency:</b> The Euro is the currency throughout France and in many other European countries.

<br><br>
<b>Climate:</b> The weather in Paris is generally quite mild for most of the year, with a reasonable amount of rain throughout the year.
<br><br>
<b>Cold season:</b> Daytime temperatures between November and February rarely get above ten degrees Celsius, but seeing Paris in the snow can add a whole new dimension to this lovely city.
<br><br>
<b>Hot season:</b> July and August are usually the hottest months in Paris.</p>
