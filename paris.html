	<p class="intro_content"><b>Language:</b> While some people may speak English or other European languages, French is by far the most spoken language in the city.
		<br><br>
<b>Currency:</b> The Euro is the currency throughout France and in many other European countries.
<br><br>
<b>Credit Cards and Banks:</b> All tourist areas will have ATMs with most hotels and restaurants accepting credit cards, although it is wise to carry some cash as small retailers may not take cards.

You’ll find that cafes and shops are more expensive the closer they are to the main attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triumph. Walk a few blocks from the main areas to find more authentic and less expensive establishments!
<br><br>
<b>Climate:</b> The weather in Paris is generally quite mild for most of the year, with a reasonable amount of rain throughout the year.
<br><br>
<b>Cold season:</b> Daytime temperatures between November and February rarely get above ten degrees Celsius, but seeing Paris in the snow can add a whole new dimension to this lovely city.
<br><br>
<b>Hot season:</b> July and August are usually the hottest months in Paris.</p>
